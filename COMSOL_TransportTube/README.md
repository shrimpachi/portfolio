This model has been made in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6

## Title
This COMSOL model shows a two-component time study (Time Dependent and Stationary) 
of a multiphysics system of Laminar Flow and Transport of Dilute Species. 
Derived from this model, we have velocity profile, pressure profile, and species concentration.
This model shows the concentration distribution of an added pulse of a different solution.

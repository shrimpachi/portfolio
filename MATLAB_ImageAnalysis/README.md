This file ('vid.m') is written for image analysis of paper rheology. 
It finds the video file, split it up in seperate images, compares all frames with the first frame.
For each measurement a calibration has been done, which is done with the file 'Calibration.m'
The difference in pixel displacement is correlated to displacement in SI-units.
Using the RGB-values, the drying process of the paper can also be measured.
